# React-Learning
This repo contains branches. Each branch demonstrates a new concept of JS or React learnt by me.
### Branch-1
This branch demonstrates the syntax and concept of components, 1-way and 2-way binding, states, onClick, onChange
### Branch-2
It restructures branch-1 to increase readability and better code management.
### Branch-3
It demonstrates lists, flexible-lists, keys, conditionals, ...spread, findIndex(), deleteOperation.
### Branch-4
This branch is based on branch-3. It splits and restructures the app into different components to increase the readability.
